# Lecture 1: Getting started with SwiftUI
- Learn systems design (how SwiftUI is doing what it is doing)
- Simulate an iOS device on our MacBook
- Build a card matching game called Memorize
- ContentView_Previews glues the preview to ContentView
- Logic code need not to import SwiftUI
- Swift supports OOP
- View is a double-edged sword:
  - Lots of functionality, but have responsibilities to behave like a View (have the var body: some view)
